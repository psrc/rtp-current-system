Here is my brain dump before your meeting on Thursday:

 

For review:

Costs are logical
Completed, canceled and new projects
Planning question adequately addressed
Plan consistency questions addressed – not Q/C’d or evaluated, just look for glaring errors
Check start and completion year for glaring issues
Descriptions have at least some basic level of adequacy, recognizing that they may not have a ton of detail
Local projects on state highways, cross check with WSDOT
 

For board:

Overall number of projects – new, returning, completed, canceled
Summation of total costs
Summary of scope elements – how many projects (and % of funding) do x/y/z
Project “scores” – total for each project and by score element (need to come up with this system)
Summary of plan consistency scores (will also need to develop what this looks like – in the past, had ranges by quartiles)
Anything else we might be able to say related to counties, regional geographies, etc. (this might need to wait until June)
 

I’m sure I’m forgetting something, but this is my quick list - K
